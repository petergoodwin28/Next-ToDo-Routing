# Next-ToDo-Routing
A simple todo app that uses tailwind css and the Next.js app router

I wanted to try dynamic routing by giving each todo a unique id and routing by that id.
I use query paramters in the url to obtain the text associated with each todo.

Created using create-next-app 

Please view the master branch to see the app folder.
